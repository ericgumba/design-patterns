# design-patterns


The goal of this repository is mainly for educational purposes. I've noticed I've learned best with multiple examples and diagrams to represent whatever  concept that I am interested in learning. So this repository will give both the contributor and reader an opportunity to learn design pattern concepts and their programming language of choice at a deeper level. Below is an example of directory structure
```
Design Patern Repository
    Programming Language
        Design Pattern Type
            Design Pattern
                Example1
                Example2
                Example3  
```
So for example if one is interested in contributing or reading an example of the strategy design pattern in Typescript, they would find it under,

```
Typescript
    Behavioral 
        Strategy
            Example1
            Example2
            Example3
```

With the example directories containing a diagram of the system and source code that fits strategy design pattern.
